Latest Hackage released version: 1.3

======================================================================
Version 1.3, 2014-08-27

  - Use the Solver type from SBV directly for picking the solver,
    avoiding bit-rot.
  - Adjust SBV dependency to >= 3.1, to get proper access to
    Solver type

======================================================================
Version 1.2, 2013-01-02

  - Allow both CVC4 and Z3 to be used as the SMT solver.
  - Adjust SBV dependency to >= 2.9, to get access to CVC4.

======================================================================
Version 1.1, 2012-10-22

  - Add solvers over rationals, in addition to just integers.
  - Adjust SBV dependency to >= 2.7 as we depend on the new Real
    instance for the AlgReal type.

======================================================================
Version 1.0, 2012-10-18

  - Initial release, contains solver for integer linear equations.
