The linearEqSolver library can be installed simply by issuing cabal install
like this:

     cabal install linearEqSolver

The library uses the sbv package on hackage, which will automatically be
installed if you do not have it already. You should also install
Z3, the default SMT solver used by sbv, from Microsoft. (You can get it
from http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/.)
Please make sure that the "z3" executable is in your path.
