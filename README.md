## linearEqSolver

Solve systems of linear equations, using SMT solvers. Both integer only solutions and solutions
over rationals are supported. Either single solutions, or all solutions can be computed.

The hackage site http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linearEqSolver is the best place for details on the API and the example use cases.
